### Vegan
The term vegan is used by activists and marketers in efforts to appeal to the vegan community. It is also often used by consumers to position animal-friendly products and nonviolent lifestyles as extreme, highly differentiated, or socially undesirable. Due to the term's polarizing nature and association with publicity-seeking activism, it is not used in public-facing contexts by people or organizations working toward progress on issues related to animal welfare and the environment.

Revealed intent: Any time the tern vegan is used in a public-facing context to discuss issues related to animal welfare or sustainability, it represents a tradeoff prioritizing the career or social interests of the communicator at the cost of alienating broader audiences from seriously considering those topics.
