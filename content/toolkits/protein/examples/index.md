## Protein is a nutrient, not a food

### "protein alternatives" is not the same as "alternative proteins"
A common misuse of protein which sometimes simply reflects carelessness of a writer seeking variety or flow in their prose. In other cases, this reflects the colloqual use of "protein" to mean animal-based proteins, which demonstrates nutritional illiteracy or attempts to appeal to confirmation bias and nutritional illiteracy of readers. Protein the nutrient could only correctly be said to have have alternatives in the context of, say, meeting caloric intake requirements, which can also be achieved by consuming other macronutrients.

### The protein industries
The protein industries refers broadly to the production of protein-rich foods. These include legumes, animal-based meat and dairy products, plant-based meat and dairy products, cell-cultured meat and dairy products, mycoprotein, algal proteins, and protein-rich foods produced by other microorganisms or through technologies such as plant molecular farming. It some cases, it may also include the production of foods that are not actually protein rich, but which serve as substitutes for common protein-rich foods, such as a low-protein oat milk used in place of higher protein plant or animal milks. It should also be noted that wheat is not generally considered as belonging to the protein industries, despite being the world's number one source of protein in terms of grams/capita/day.
