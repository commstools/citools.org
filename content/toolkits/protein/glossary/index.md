## Protein
Protein has multiple meanings. In chemistry, it refers to a class of molecule. In nutrition, protein refers to one of the three macronutrients along with fats and carbohydrates. This toolkit deals with protein the nutrient.

### Protein is a nutrient, not a food
Protein is found in nearly all foods. However, the term "protein" is often used incorrectly to refer to certain protein-rich foods. This may be due to nutritional illiteracy, an attempt to elicit confirmation bias by using scientific terms, or a combination of such factors.

See [this example](/toolkits/protein/examples#protein-is-a-nutrient-not-a-food) for a case when misuse of "protein" caused a mainstream media outlet to publish false and misleading information in a major feature--including in its subtitle.

## Signaling
Indirect methods of communicating a position on a topic.

Modern information environments allow for highly granular approaches to signialing, ranging from crude and overt to subtle and covert. Communicators insert social signals into their messaging in a number of ways:

* Tone and terminology
* The publications, personalities, and authors they choose to reference
* Online interactions in the form of likes, comments, and shares
* Visual imagery, including display of logos and other symbols

## Framing
The aggregate context and character of how information is presented.

Framing can involve selective or strategic use of information or narrative to impact how information is received. Similar to signaling, modern communicators make use of all available mediums to frame the topics on which they focus. However, the absence, presence, or extent of social signaling may be just one part of how a particular topic is framed by a communicator.

## Revealed intent
The objective that is demonstrated or *revealed* by a communication activity.

"Talk is cheap... Actions speak louder than words... Put your money where your mouth is." These expressions all refer to a common phenomenon: Behavior often reveals different motivations, values, and priorities than what is said in conversations, surveys, interviews, op-eds, speeches, presentations, and mission statements. In fact, there is an entire discipline called microeconomics that exists largely to study how actors in any system make decisions by modeling and observing what they do, rather than merely what they say.

In order to effectively utilze this toolkit, one must practice evaluating disparities between revealed intentions or priorities and those stated by the communicating individual or organization. In many cases, the opening sentences of an op-ed reveal quickly whether the author is adding partisanship to a space for personal gain or genuinely contributing to a better information environment.

## Rigorous neutrality
Diligent implementation of standards and careful monitoring of communication outputs.

Companies and organizations that are otherwise neutral may appear to not to be if their communication channels become populated with non-neutral messaging. This may occur due to an absence of communication standards or lax implementation.

A rigorous approach to neutrality does not mean merely implementing standards in one's own channels. It also means maintaining a strict firewall between your organization and those that contribute to a polarized or tribalistic information environment.

Recall, small interactions such as likes, shares, and comments on social media are communication outputs. 

## Risk
Refers broadly to both hazards and the probabilities of their occurance.

### Political risk
Refers to the risk that leaders may face in their careers, business, or policy objectives by engaging on an issue. 

### Social currency


### Social risk
Refers to social and cultural resistance to engage or give fair consideration to a topic.

Modern information environments reward communications that build social barriers around culturally sensitive topics. 

## Principles
Conceptually or strategically fundamental statements.

## Standards
Applications of principles for specific use cases and contexts. Standards are esentially collections of rules that together for 

## Tribalism
Refers to feelings of  the influence of social identity and group affiliations on positions, perceptions, and behaviors

## Social psychology
Refers to the psychology of 

## Public-facing
The guides presented on citools are intended to be used in any situation for which **how** inforamtion is communicated matters. This is always the case for public-facing communications around sensitive or controversial topics. It may or may not be the case for internal organizational communications or for private conversations among individuals or small groups.

Example: A blog article uses mostly scientific publications as references, but includes one or two links to news articles from activist or highly partisan publications. The editor allows it to pass since they are only concerned with the raw information, not how it is framed or presented.

In modern, high-choice information environments, this kind of decision, whether intentional or unwitting, provides implicit endorsement of all sources.

Framing communications is like building a house: the location, architecture, materials, windows, doors, colors, quality of construction, etc., all contribute to perception, feeling, and understanding, regardless of what books are on the bookshelf. Similarly, publication, author, affiliations, language, tone, sources, and style all contribute to how information is received and understood, regardless of the information itself.

Example: An organization states its mission is to mainstream the adoption of a potentially revolutionary but controversial new technology, but in practice, engages in communications that contribute to polarization and alienate mainstream audiences. This may be due to social incentives of team members seeking recognition in their own community. This is an example of revealed prioritiesâ€”in this case, pursuing recognition in their community, even at the cost of progress for their stated objectives.

Example: an organization states a goal of influencing policy, but in practice amplifies voices online that add political risk and make its topics more difficult for policy makers to approach.

In modern information environments, incentives to compromise are constant, and seemingly small compromises add up.
