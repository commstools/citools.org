## Principles

{{< callout context="caution" >}}
Use technically accurate language accessible to audiences from diverse backgrounds. Avoid polarizing terms. Instead, choose neutral words that convey equivalent information and clarity. Resist temptations to rally likeminded peers using language that may alienate or reduce resonance among others. Support advancement of scientific and nutritional literacy around protein.

        Protein is a scientific term with two distinct meanings. In nutrition, it refers to one of three macronutrients along with carbohydrates and fats. In chemistry, it refers to a class of molecule. This toolkit refers only to protein the nutrient.
        <br><br>
        Despite being a well-defined scientific term, "protein" has emerged as a popular colloquialism used simply to refer to foods that are rich in protein. Although such usages may be benign in private, informal contexts, failure to differentiate between scientific and colloquial meanings of the term can be problematic in more formal and public-facing communications. For instance:
        <br><br>
        <ul>
        <li>Audiences may believe that in order obtain a sufficient quantity or quality of dietary protein, they must consume "protein" as colloquially defined in their social, cultural, or information environment</li>
        <li>Audiences may believe that sustainability challenges related to "protein" (the colloquialism) are unavoidable because protein (the nutrient) is essential in their diets</li>
        </ul>
        Arguments or statements that draw false conclusions by confounding multiple meanings of a single term are known to suffer from a fallacy of equivocation. As logic is one of the two pillars of scientific knowledge alongside observation, advancing scientific literacy and critical thinking around protein begins with correcting such elementary logic errors -- especially in the scientific community and in public-facing communications that claim to be supported by scientific reasoning.

        "Alternative protein" has emerged as a popular term describing products developed to imitate or replace animal-based foods such as meat, dairy, and eggs. It is further used to describe the broader industry surrounding such products, including the technologies, organizations, and companies carrying out related work.
        <br><br>
        Additionally, because of the likely stainability and animal welfare advantages of such products, "alternative protein" has become a focal point and defining term for activism and alternative lifestyle communities. Due to the social and often vocal, publicity-seeking nature of such groups, the term also refers to a social movement rooted in activism and alternative lifestyles.
        <br><br>
        In practice, the "alternative protein" industry and social movement are deeply intertwined, creating a complex set of social, professional, and financial incentivies fueling its growth -- and strengthening its opposition. 
        <br><br>
        When used with sufficient context, "alternative protein" is neither a source of ambiguitiy nor socially antagonistic connotations. However, most popular usage of the term fails to provide such context, instead relying on its buzzword status as a social signal or rallying call for support. Such usage diverges from this toolkit's principles for several reasons:
        <br><br>
        <ol>
        <li>Neutrality: It derives meaning from a social movement, a large body of which positions itself as ideologically polarized and adversarial toward others</li>
        <li>Specificity: It does not clearly differentiate between scientific and colloquial meanings of the term "protein," thereby contributing to confusion around related topics</li>
        <li>Integrity: Popular usage often directly contradicts statements of purpose by users, such as claiming to support mainstream adoption of "alternative protein" products or social values</li>
        </ol>
        A primary argument for broad usage of "alternative protein" is that the reality of current markets and dietary patterns dictates the alternative nature of non-animal-based protein-rich foods. Addressing this with the intention of "creating a future where alternative proteins are no longer alternative" is a common rationale within the alternative protein social movement.
        <br><br>
        On paper, such reasoning would only be guilty of a lack of strategic thinking -- the first step in creating such a world would be not to brand oneself as alternative. In practice, the statement of purpose also does not align with the movement's activities, which appear to be dedicated to preserving alternative protein as a counterculture activist movement. This is evidenced by the selection of media outlets, terminology, and figures that dominate the alternative protein infospace. This is a movement with roots in publicity-seeking activism that continues to be driven by activists and alternative lifestyle enthusiasts.

        The protein industries refers broadly to the production of protein-rich foods. These include legumes, animal-based meat and dairy products, plant-based meat and dairy products, cell-cultured meat and dairy products, mycoprotein, algal proteins, and protein-rich foods produced by other microorganisms or through technologies such as plant molecular farming. It some cases, it may also include the production of foods that are not protein rich, but which serve as substitutes for common protein-rich foods. One example is oat milk, which is often used in place of other plant- or animal-based milks. It should also be noted that wheat is not generally considered a protein-rich food, despite it being the world's primary source of protein in terms of grams/capita/day.

        <td>
        The term vegan is used by activists and marketers in efforts to appeal to the vegan community. It is also often used by consumers to position animal-friendly products and nonviolent lifestyles as extreme, highly differentiated, or socially undesirable. Due to the term's polarizing nature and association with publicity-seeking activism, it is not used in public-facing contexts by people or organizations working toward progress on issues related to animal welfare and the environment. <br><br>Revealed intent: Any time the term vegan is used in a public-facing context to discuss issues related to animal welfare or sustainability, it represents a tradeoff prioritizing the career or social interests of the communicator at the cost of alienating broader audiences from seriously considering those topics.

## Additional notes and considerations

Words are dynamic. Their definitions, and even pronunciations, can vary over time and across geographies and contexts.  Cellular agriculture, once a neutral term used to describe a new industry, has failed to resist the grip of modern social insticnts and incentives. What those in the cellular agriculture industry and advocacy fields fail to consider in all their pontificating about terminology is that
