## Principles

{{< callout context="caution" >}}
Use technically accurate language accessible to audiences from diverse backgrounds. Avoid polarizing terms. Instead, choose neutral words that convey equivalent information and clarity. Resist temptations to rally likeminded peers using language that may alienate or reduce resonance among others. Support advancement of scientific and nutritional literacy around protein.

        Protein is a scientific term with two distinct meanings. In nutrition, it refers to one of three macronutrients along with carbohydrates and fats. In chemistry, it refers to a class of molecule. This toolkit refers only to protein the nutrient.
        <br><br>
        Despite being a well-defined scientific term, "protein" has emerged as a popular colloquialism used simply to refer to foods that are rich in protein. Although such usages may be benign in private, informal contexts, failure to differentiate between scientific and colloquial meanings of the term can be problematic in more formal and public-facing communications. For instance:
        <br><br>
        <ul>
        <li>Audiences may believe that in order obtain a sufficient quantity or quality of dietary protein, they must consume "protein" as colloquially defined in their social, cultural, or information environment</li>
        <li>Audiences may believe that sustainability challenges related to "protein" (the colloquialism) are unavoidable because protein (the nutrient) is essential in their diets</li>
        </ul>
        Arguments or statements that draw false conclusions by confounding multiple meanings of a single term are known to suffer from a fallacy of equivocation. As logic is one of the two pillars of scientific knowledge alongside observation, advancing scientific literacy and critical thinking around protein begins with correcting such elementary logic errors -- especially in the scientific community and in public-facing communications that claim to be supported by scientific reasoning.

        "Alternative protein" has emerged as a popular term describing products developed to imitate or replace animal-based foods such as meat, dairy, and eggs. It is further used to describe the broader industry surrounding such products, including the technologies, organizations, and companies carrying out related work.
        <br><br>
        Additionally, because of the likely sustainability and animal welfare advantages of such products, "alternative protein" has become a focal point and defining term for activist and alternative lifestyle communities. Due to the social and often vocal, publicity-seeking nature of such groups, the term also refers to a social movement rooted in activism and alternative lifestyles.
        <br><br>
        In practice, the "alternative protein" industry and social movement are deeply intertwined, creating a complex set of social, professional, and financial incentivies fueling its growth, while strengthening opposition from competing industries and ideologies. 
        <br><br>
        When used with sufficient context, "alternative protein" is neither a source of ambiguitiy nor socially divisive connotations. However, most popular usage of the term fails to provide such context, instead relying on its buzzword status as a social signal or rallying call to likeminded peers. Such usage diverges from this toolkit's principles for a couple of reasons:
        <br><br>
        <ol>
        <li>Neutrality: It derives meaning from a social movement, a large body of which positions itself as ideologically polarized and adversarial toward others</li>
        <li>Specificity: It does not clearly differentiate between scientific and colloquial meanings of the term "protein," thereby contributing to confusion around related topics</li>
        </ol>
        In addition to the above, popular usage of "alternative protein" often demonstrates a low level of communication integrity, as it reveals priorities that directly contradict many statements in which it is used. For instance:
        <br><br>
        <ul>
        <li>Communicators aiming to advance mainstream adoption of alternatives to animal-based protein sources, or to promote constructive policy dialogues around such topics, are careful to avoid socially contentious positioning that may compromise their work. In contrast, those leveraging polarized social signals in their messaging demonstrates a clear willingness to sacrifice progress on such goals in favor of other rewards gained from alignment with a social movement or industry trend.</li>
        <li>Communicators working toward such goals would also be unlikely to land on "alternative" as the primary theme for their branding and positioning, as the term, by definition, is neither default nor mainstream or traditional. Further, the "alternative" positioning is likely to be unappealing in food and agriculture contexts where "tradition" and social harmony is often celebrated and championed.</li>
        </ul>
        It should be noted that the above points are not an appeal to lingustic purism or an argument that "alternative" cannot be used to describe anything aiming to influence or become mainstream. Rather, it is merely an observation regarding the low liklihood that such a term would be chosen by communicators thinking strategically toward such a goal, therefore revealing a different priority of its user.

### Protein Industries

        <td>Usage:</td>

        <td>
        The protein industries refers broadly to the production of protein-rich foods. These include legumes, animal-based meat and dairy products, plant-based meat and dairy products, cell-cultured meat and dairy products, mycoprotein, algal proteins, and protein-rich foods produced by other microorganisms or through technologies such as plant molecular farming. It some cases, it may also include the production of foods that are not protein rich, but which serve as substitutes for common protein-rich foods. One example is oat milk, which is often used in place of other plant- or animal-based milks. It should also be noted that wheat is not generally considered a protein-rich food, despite it being the world's primary source of protein in terms of grams/capita/day.

        <td>
        The term vegan is used by activists and marketers in efforts to appeal to the vegan community. It is also often used by consumers to position animal-friendly products and nonviolent lifestyles as extreme, highly differentiated, or socially undesirable. Due to the term's polarizing nature and association with publicity-seeking activism, it is not used in public-facing contexts by people or organizations working toward progress on issues related to animal welfare and the environment. <br><br>Revealed intent: Any time the term vegan is used in a public-facing context to discuss issues related to animal welfare or sustainability, it represents a tradeoff prioritizing the career or social interests of the communicator at the cost of alienating broader audiences from seriously considering those topics.

## Additional notes and considerations

Words are dynamic. Their definitions, and even pronunciations, can vary over time and across geographies and contexts.  Cellular agriculture, once a neutral term used to describe a new industry, has failed to resist the grip of modern social insticnts and incentives. What those in the cellular agriculture industry and advocacy fields fail to consider in all their pontificating about terminology is that
