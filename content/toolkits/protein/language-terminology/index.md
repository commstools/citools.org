## Principles

{{< callout context="caution" >}}
Use technically accurate language accessible to audiences from diverse backgrounds. Avoid polarizing terms. Instead, choose neutral words that convey equivalent information and clarity. Resist temptations to rally likeminded peers using language that might alienate or reduce resonance among others. Support advancement of scientific and nutritional literacy around protein.

        Protein is a scientific term with two distinct meanings. In nutrition, it refers to one of three macronutrients along with carbohydrates and fats. In chemistry, it refers to a class of molecule. This toolkit refers only to protein the nutrient.
        <br><br>
        Despite being a well-defined scientific term, "protein" has emerged as a popular colloquialism used simply to refer to foods that are rich in protein, typically of animal origin. Although such usages may be benign in private, informal environments, failure to differentiate between scientific and colloquial meanings of the term can be problematic in formal and public-facing contexts. For instance:
        <br><br>
        <ul>
        <li>Audiences may believe that in order obtain a sufficient quantity or quality of dietary protein, they must consume "protein" as colloquially defined in their social, cultural, or information environment</li>
        <li>Audiences may believe that sustainability or food security challenges related to "protein" (the colloquialism) are unavoidable because protein (the nutrient) is essential in our diets</li>
        </ul>
        Arguments or statements that draw false conclusions by confounding multiple meanings of a single term are known to suffer from a fallacy of equivocation. As logic is one of the two pillars of scientific knowledge alongside observation, advancing scientific literacy and critical thinking around protein begins with correcting such elementary logical fallacies -- especially in the scientific community and in public-facing communications that claim to be supported by scientific reasoning.
        <br><br>
        The ubiquity of colloquial usage is one of the primary arguments against dilligently maintaining the term's scientific meaning. This belies another logic error known as the popularity fallacy: ubiquity does not imply correctness. While it is true the meanings of words change over time, the protein colloquialism problem has nothing to do with the dynamic nature of language. Rather, it is a dilemma of integrity of science communication and public understanding of science.
        <br><br>
        Intent regarding colloquial usages of "protein" can vary from deliberate disinformation to entirely innocent lack of critical thinking around such issues. Nevertheless, diluting or changing the meanings of scientific terms to align with social or cultural beliefs, opinions, preferences, or behaviors -- intentional or otherwise -- must be recognized as a pathology of social psychology with potentially serious consequencies.

        "Alternative protein" has emerged as a popular term used to describe products designed to imitate or replace animal-based foods such as meat, dairy, and eggs. In addition to such products, the technologies, projects, organizations, businesses, and communities focused on the development and advocacy for

        As a result, "alternative protein" is widely used in reference to products and technologies, as well as the projects, organizations, and communities aiming to capitalize on this trend -- socially, professionally, or financially.  The projects, communities, events, and publications have been launched to capitalize on this trend, either socially, professionally, or financially. <br><br>
        Usage of "alternative protein" diverges from this toolkit's language and terminology principles for several reasons:

        Ironically, these factors work directly against the interests of the goals the "alternative protein" community claims to most champion:

        To be clear, the alternative protein community is responsible for much of the funding and research . However, progress in those areas is happening despite the community's approach to framing and communicating their work, not becuase of it. In practice, this community is building cultural barriers and political risk into the technologies and topics they claim to be working to advance. 
         As such, activity in "alternative protein" communities is 
        "Alternative protein" is problematic for a number of reasons.

        A common misuse of protein which sometimes simply reflects carelessness of a writer seeking variety or flow in their prose. In other cases, this reflects the colloqual use of "protein" to mean animal-based proteins, which demonstrates nutritional illiteracy or attempts to appeal to confirmation bias and nutritional illiteracy of readers. Protein the nutrient could only correctly be said to have have alternatives in the context of, say, meeting caloric intake requirements, which can also be achieved by consuming other macronutrients.
        <br><br>
        A primary argument for broad usage of "alternative protein" is that the reality of current markets and dietary patterns dictates the alternative nature of non-animal-based protein-rich foods. Addressing this with the intention of "creating a world where alternative proteins are no longer alternative" is a common rationale within the alternative protein movement. On paper, such reasoning would only be guilty of an inane lack of strategic thinking - the first step in creating such a world would be not to brand oneself as alternative. In practice, the statement of purpose also does not align with the movement's activities, which appear to be dedicated to preserving alternative protein as a counterculture activist movement. This is evidenced by the selection of media outlets, terminology, and figures that dominate the alternative protein infospace. This is a movement with roots in publicity-seeking activism that continues to be driven activists and alternative lifestyle enthusiasts.

        The protein industries refers broadly to the production of protein-rich foods. These include legumes, animal-based meat and dairy products, plant-based meat and dairy products, cell-cultured meat and dairy products, mycoprotein, algal proteins, and protein-rich foods produced by other microorganisms or through technologies such as plant molecular farming. It some cases, it may also include the production of foods that are not protein rich, but which serve as substitutes for common protein-rich foods. One example is oat milk, which is often used in place of other plant- or animal-based milks. It should also be noted that wheat is not generally considered a protein-rich food, despite it being the world's primary source of protein in terms of grams/capita/day.

        The term vegan is used by activists and marketers in efforts to appeal to the vegan community. It is also often used by consumers to position animal-friendly products and nonviolent lifestyles as extreme, highly differentiated, or socially undesirable. Due to the term's polarizing nature and association with publicity-seeking activism, it is not used in public-facing contexts by people or organizations working toward progress on issues related to animal welfare and the environment. <br><br>Revealed intent: Any time the term vegan is used in a public-facing context to discuss issues related to animal welfare or sustainability, it represents a tradeoff prioritizing the career or social interests of the communicator at the cost of alienating broader audiences from seriously considering those topics.

## Additional notes and considerations

Words are dynamic. Their definitions, and even pronunciations, can vary over time and across geographies and contexts.  Cellular agriculture, once a neutral term used to describe a new industry, has failed to resist the grip of modern social insticnts and incentives. What those in the cellular agriculture industry and advocacy fields fail to consider in all their pontificating about terminology is that
