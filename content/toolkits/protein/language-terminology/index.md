## Principles

{{< callout context="caution" >}}
* Use language palatable to audiences from varying backgrounds. Resist temptations to rally likeminded peers using language that might alienate or reduce resonance among others. 
* Avoid polarizing terms. Choose neutral words that convey equivalent information and clarity wherever possible.

{{< callout context="caution" >}}
* Support advancment of scientific and nutritional literacy around protein and related topics. Discourage cultural polarization and tribalism around protein sources and their impacts. Help reduce political risk for actors whose decisions have disproportionate impact, such as policy makers, corporates, investors, and philanthropists.

{{< callout context="caution" >}}
* Champion scientific literacy and critical reasoning. Uphold communications practices that support fact-based understanding of reality. Discourage practices that dilute or change meanings of well-defined terms and encourage consensus-based understandings of reality.

        Protein is a scientific term with two distinct meanings. In nutrition, it refers to one of the three macronutrients alongside fats and carbohydrates. In chemistry, it refers to a class of molecule. This toolkit deals only with protein the nutrient.
        <br><br>
         Despite being a well-defined scientific term, "protein" has emerged as a popular colloquialism used simply to refer to foods that are rich in protein, typically of animal origin. Although such usages may be benign in private, informal environments, failure to differentiate between scientific and colloquial meanings of the term can be problematic in formal and public-facing contexts. For instance:
        <ul>
        <li>Audiences may erroneously believe that in order obtain a sufficient quantity or quality of dietary protein, they must consume "protein" as colloquially defined in their social, cultural, or informational environment</li>
        <li>Audiences may erroneously believe that sustainability or food security challenges related to "protein" (the colloquialism) are unavoidable because protein (the nutrient) is essential in our diets</li>
        </ul>
        Such arguments or statements that draw false conclusions by confounding multiple meanings of a single term are known to suffer from a fallacy of equivocation. As logic is one of the two pillars of scientific knowledge alongside observation, advancing scientific literacy around protein begins with correcting and discouraging such common and basic logical fallacies -- especially in the scientific community and in public-facing communications that claim to be supported by scientific reasoning.
        <br><br>
        The degree of intentionality regarding colloquial usages can vary from deliberate disinformation to innocent lack of critical thinking. Nevertheless, efforts that dilute or change the meanings of scientific terms to align them with social or cultural beliefs, opinions, preferences, or behaviors -- intentional or otherwise -- should be recognized as a harmful pathology of social psychology with potentially serious consequencies. This can be viewed as part of broader "post-truth" trends that encourage community-specific consensus-based, rather than fact-based, understandings of reality, to the detriment of public health, national security, democratic instituions, prosperity, justice, and social stability.
        <br><br>
        Protein is at the core of all these topics. 
        Using scientific terms such as protein. This is akin to terms such as "exponential" being used to emphasize scale, or "literally" being used in place of "very." However,  
        As a scientific term, usage of "protein" hints at a scientific understanding and basis for its usage. This may be why "protein" has emerged as a popular colloquialism in reference to certain protein-rich foods, typically of animal origin. While such usages simlpy as "protein" and may appeal to  elicit positive feelings in audiences that wish to align their beliefs or behaviors with those of sound scientific argument. Ironically, such usages often demonstrate and promote scientific and nutritional illiteracy regarding protein sources and dietary needs.

        The term vegan is used by activists and marketers in efforts to appeal to the vegan community. It is also often used by consumers to position animal-friendly products and nonviolent lifestyles as extreme, highly differentiated, or socially undesirable. Due to the term's polarizing nature and association with publicity-seeking activism, it is not used in public-facing contexts by people or organizations working toward progress on issues related to animal welfare and the environment. <br><br>Revealed intent: Any time the term vegan is used in a public-facing context to discuss issues related to animal welfare or sustainability, it represents a tradeoff prioritizing the career or social interests of the communicator at the cost of alienating broader audiences from seriously considering those topics.
