### Formalizing CI
Partisanship and communication integrity are not Boolean in nature.

The virtually unlimited possibilities of expression through language is part of what makes it such a powerful tool--the subtle evocation of thoughts, feelings, and layering of information, either by intent or accident, also makes it nearly impossible to accurately quantify the true quality or nature of a piece of writing. Modern tools for conducting sentiment analysis may be impressive and useful for many purposes, but they also run the risk of reporting false results.

Nonetheless, when key parameters have been well defined, some partisanship and integrity metrics become easily quantifiable. Namely:

- partisan or partisan organization-affiliated author (Boolean)
- terminology used (Boolean)
- number of occurances of partisan terminology (integer)
- concentration of occurances of partisan terminology (decimal)
- partisan personalities or affiliated referenced or quoted (Boolean)
- number of partisan or affiliated personalities referenced or quoted (integer)
- concentration of quotes or references from partisan or affiliated personalities (decimal)
- partisan organization quoted or referenced (Boolean)
- number of partisan organizations quoted or referenced (integer)
- references to partisan publications (Boolean)
- number of references to partisan publications (integer)
- concentration of references to partisan sources (decimal)
- citation quality: minimum number of clicks to arrive on partisan content or source (integer)
- citation quality: average number of clicks to arrive on partisan content or source (decimal)

These make it possible to conceive of quantitative partisanship and communincation integrity indices communicators and other stakeholders can use to evaluate the true impact of an organization, campaign, or other activity that involves public-facing communication.
