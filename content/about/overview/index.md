### What is CITools
CITools is a collection of tools and resources for improving how dialogues are conducted and information is shared in modern communication environments. It provides a generalized approach to understanding and evaluating communication integrity, as well as a collection of toolkits for optimizing communications related to specific topics.

### What is communication integrity
Communication integrity refers to a message or activity's quality of fitness for a stated purpose. To evaluate the integrity of a particular communication activity, one can simply ask: "does it help achieve the stated aim of the communicator?" When there is a significant difference between the stated aim and fitness of an activity for achieving that aim, it is said to be of low CI. It is important to note this outcome is not always intentional. See the [FAQ](/about/faq) for some common examples and causes of low-CI activities.

### Structure of CITools
CITools is structured as a collection of toolkits. Each toolkit begins with an overview of concepts and definitions specific its subject matter. At the heart of each toolkit is a code of practice--a set of standards that can be utilized as-is or adapted to the needs of an organization. Each toolkit also contains modules--components that can be updated independently of the main document content--and examples to help users see the toolkit in action. Finally, each toolkit contains an FAQ section where users can reference common questions and answers, as well as ask questions and contribute examples they think will help other users.
