### Eexamples of low-CI activities
1. A politician claims to promote peace, but utilizes rhetoric and messaging that encourages conflict
2. A company or organization claims an ambitious mission of broad impact but in practice utilizes polarizing, community-specific messaging that hinders such impact
4. A team member organizes a partnership or communication campaign that advances their own personal or career interests at the cost of optimal positioning for their organization

### Common ways CI is compromised
Communication integrity can be compromised in more than one way.

* disingenuous intent of the communicator
* social or commercial pressues or incentives
* lack of expertise in a message's subject matter
* failure of organizations to define and implement communications standards

In many cases, low-CI messaging is due to a combination of these factors.
