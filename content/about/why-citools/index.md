### Modern challenges

Access to large-scale communications infrastructure used to be costly. For most of the past century, launching a print or broadcast media outlet required significant investments in physical and human capital. Only a few could reach geographically diverse audiences, and among those, print space and air time were limted. Today, there are viturally no barriers to entry--anyone with access to a computer or smartphone can communicate with the world. This low-cost, easy access to modern digital communications infrastructure brings with it a complicated set of societal benefits and risks:

**Benefit:** Information and education are more readily available across diverse geographies and demographics, promising greater equality of opportunity and forcing transparency and accountability in governance. Intellectual and analytical perspectives can more easily gain exposure, offering the potential for a more meritocratic marketplace of ideas.

**Risk:** At the same time, there are fewer incentives to moderate partisan communications. On the contrary, online media, social media, and collbaorative information environments often reward polarization and tribalism in communications. Misinformation, beliefs, and ideologies that can erode civil insitutions and threaten social stability spread quickly and gain legitmacy in political dialogues.

### 

This scarcity meant companies and organizations often needed to spend large sums on traditional advertising in order to communicate with the public. In such an envirtonment, editorial coverage--good or bad--at least offered exposure, hence the old adage "there's no such thing as bad publicity."

High capital requirements also incentivized moderation. Print and brodcast media outlets competing for mainstream audiences needed qualified team members to enforce standards accordingly, while balancing the interests of investors, advertisers, and regulators. Similarly, businessees, organizations, and political entities were incentivized to craft messaging for broad impact to minimize risk of costly campaign activities. This structure did not always support high standards for truth, but it did foster a degree of moderation in mass communications, and in turn, among audiences.

 Anyone with an idea can launch a company or organization and reach millions with little or no capital.

Print and broadcast media outlets have also been forced compete in the digital space, eroding their previous commitments to neutrality and broad appeal in favor of partisan audiences.

Populism, anti-science ideologies, and the new wave of politicians may just be a period of adolescence the world must go through as it adapts to newly free communications technologies. But how it is treated and understood may affect how we come out on the other side. Some may argue for a lasse faire approach to innovation, invoking high-minded long term views of evolution at any cost. These views are especially appealing to subscribers to ideologies such as libertarianism, social darwinism, and other flavors of religious psychology. They merely mask a lack of critical reasoning. 

PR departments, specialized agencies, or designated team members used to be solely responsible for 

Lasse faire embracing of a marketplace of ideas with faith that the best ones will win. This type of faith-based position, though cannot be disproved, is high risk and often a cop out for a failure to think critically or prioritize things over social incentivies. 

### Individuals vs. organizations

In the past, technological and structural barriers meant 

In the past, organizational communications were primarily managed by PR departments, agencies, or designated team members. However, in modern online media, social media, and collaborative information environments, every individual may easily become a public-facing representative of their organization — sometimes even unintentionally. Team members are also more empowered to impact organizational positioning according to their own incentives, values, and priorities.

In this context, organizations that fail to implement communication standards open themselves, and the success of their objectives, to increased risk.

People are the most important asset of any organization. The ideas, perspectives, skills, and talents of unique individuals are the source of all organizational value. But organizations and business entities are fundamentally different from the teams and individuals that form them:

Organizations are defined by missions, standards, and structures; they may also have commitments to the public or specific groups to which they are responsible.

Individual team members, on the other hand, can be far more varied and dynamic.

### The solution is standards
CITools provides well-defined standards and a mechanism to ensure their implementation. 

The resources on CITools are not intended to replace the good judgement of team members. On the contrary, they assume a high level of commitment, competence, and ability to be guided by strategic principles—not merely follow rules.

This enables organizations of all kinds to quickly and easily optimize commuications outputs, reduce risk, and contribute to a better web.



 Today, anyone with a laptop or smartphone can communicate with the world. 

Capital requirements and other barriers to entry meant launching a print publication or broadcast media outlet was difficult.  

Today, there are virtually no barriers to entry to keep anyone from communicating with the world. This leveling of the field has been wonderful for . While it holds the potential for fostering a more meritocratic information environment, it also the potential to spread dangerous beliefs, ideologies, and behaviors that threaten public health, social stability, and planetary survival.
